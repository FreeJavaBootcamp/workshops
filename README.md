Welcome to the repository for the Free Java Bootcamp workshop! Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of exercise files. Our workshops are designed to provide an engaging and interactive learning experience using Jupyter Notebooks and IJava. Each workshop file is conveniently labeled with a number, such as `W01`, and contains detailed notes and exercises dedicated to a specific topic. Get ready to embark on an exciting Java learning journey with us!

## Getting Setup

Follow the steps below in order to set up your development environment for executing the exercises.

### 1. Install pip and python

Jupiter Notebooks uses Python to run. Visit [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install Python for your development environment.

### 2. Install Jupyter notebooks

After installing Python, use pip to install Jupyter notebooks. as shown in [this short guide](https://jupyter.org/install)
We recommend using Classic Jupyter notebooks but any of the flavors listed is also okay.

### 3. Install JDK 9+

The IJava plugin requires that you have a version of JDK greater than 9 installed because it uses `Jshell` to function
You can install the latest version of OpenJDK by following [this link](https://openjdk.org/install/)

### 4. Install IJava

Finally, install IJava by following the steps in [this documentation](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava#installing)
